Release Notes -- Apache PDFBox -- Version 1.7.1

Introduction
------------

The Apache PDFBox library is an open source Java tool for working with PDF documents.

This is an incremental bugfix release based on the earlier 1.7.0 release.

This version also includes the new PDF/A preflight module. Due to some unfinished 
refactoring we decided to release them source only. Uncomment the commented entries
in the reactor pom to build your own jars.

For more details on all fixes and improvements included in this release, please
refer to the following issues on the PDFBox issue tracker at 
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PDFBOX.
